# Problem statement
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.

> Given an object

```json

{"a":{"b":{"c":"d"}}}

```

> and the key =

`` a/b/c ``

the function to return

```json

d

```
